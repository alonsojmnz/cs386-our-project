# Muscle Memory 
Welcome to our project for the CS386 course at NAU. Our project is called "Muscle Memory."
We hope to bring a new and fun way for people to actively track information pertaining to 
nutrients, calorie intake, burnt calories, and more.

## Prerequisites
The softwares we used are AWS and Node.js. If you download these then we just host our project 
on a web server that anyone should be able to access.

## Installing
We are deploying our system using NodeJS with Express on AWS. The AWS machine is an Ubuntu VM
we are connecting to through SSH and using only to host the website, and this is all that is 
necessary to install our project.

## Running the tests
Automated tests are used on our javascript functions such as our BMR calculator.
Downloading a service like JUnit or another Javascript compatible testing service will
work perfectly to test the code. These tests effectively ensure that all calculators and 
other functions we implement work how we would like them to so we do not have problems when
we launch the website for users.

## Deployment
Once you've connected through SSH oyu should be able to go on the website and allow other
users to as well.

## Built With
* AWS- Ubuntu Virtual Machine
